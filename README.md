# 2D Elastic Collision 

2D elastic collision engine implemented in python. 
It contains two distinct methods (trigonometry and free angle representation). 
Both techniques have been tested and show exactly the same results. 

The following classes can be easily implemented into a 2D game (top down or horizontal/vertical scrolling) to generate
a real time elastic collision engine, or used for educational purpose.
