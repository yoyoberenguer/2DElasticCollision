# 2D Elastic Collision 

2D elastic collision engine implemented in python. 
It contains two distinc methods (trigonometry and free angle representation). 
Both technics have been tested and show exactly the same results. 

The following classes can be easily implemented into a 2D game (top down or horizontal/vertical scrolling) to generate
a real time elastic collision engine.



Angle free


Trigonometry 



                        


* - TRIGONOMETY : Timing result for 100000 iterations  : 2.093596862793334s
* - ANGLE FREE  : Timing result for 100000 iterations  : 0.4719169265488081s
